          <h3>Instructions:</h3> <br /> <br />
          <p>
            1. Select your starting and end station for both morning and night
            commutes{" "}
          </p>
          <br /> <br />
          <p>2. Select wether the journeys begin at peak or off peak times. </p>
          <br /> <br />
          <p>
            Peak fares - Monday to Friday (not on public holidays) journeys
            starting between 06:30 and 09:30, and between 16:00 and 19:00.
            <br /> <br />
            Off-peak fares - at all other times and if you travel from a station
            outside Zone 1 to a station in Zone 1 between 16:00 and 19:00,
            Monday to Friday.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            3. Select number of bus trips, each one allows unlimited tap on/off
            bus and trams for one hour. Only select more than one if you need to
            switch buses after one hour. <br /> <br />
            4. Use simple if you travel same commute Mon-Fri and want basic
            average commute cost. Use custom to select commute for every day
            including weekends.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            All fares assume you are not tapping out or switching trains to
            avoid zone 1. Fares and routes are calculated as using best route
            from TFL trip planner.{" "}

              If fare shows Â£0, TFL could not find a tube journey between the
              two stations. Select another station.
